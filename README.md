## Welcome to ei (Escape Idiocracy)

Greetings, fellow intellectuals and those who still have a few brain cells left!

### What is this?

**ei** is my desperate attempt to escape the ever-encroaching idiocracy that seems to be taking over the world. Inspired by the movie "Idiocracy," this project is a beacon of hope for those who refuse to succumb to the dumbing down of society.

### Why?

Because someone has to do it! The world is turning into a place where intelligence is a rare commodity, and I, for one, refuse to let it happen without a fight. This project is my way of pushing back against the tide of stupidity, buy makeing me rich and ruleling the world for a better good

### Features

- **Advanced Algorithms**: Because simple solutions are for simple minds.
- **Cutting-Edge Technology**: Utilizing the latest and greatest in AI and machine learning to stay ahead of the curve.
- **Humor**: Because if we don't laugh, we'll cry.

### Installation

To install **ei**, you'll need Python 3.12 or higher. Simply run:

```sh
pip install -e .
```
